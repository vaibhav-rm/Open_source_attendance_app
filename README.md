## Deployment

To deploy this project

*Go to https://script.google.com and upload these files to a new project and deploy them as a web app, we will need the webapp url so save it for later.


## Features

- Data directly stored to google sheets
- Easy to use and deploy/maintain
- Authentication system does not need coding
- Cross platform
- Uses unique id in qr code
- Data can be easily shared


## Frontend

The frontend can be anything as long as it has an encrypction system and an authentication system to then feed the user id to the spreadsheet. This can be done with the help of webapp url we got from googlescript website.
## Optimizations

The app which I developed for this project was made in mit app inventor so it limited the functionality greatly. I would want to make this app in an android framework to add more security.

## Running Tests

To run tests, Change the parameters of the url and check the output.

```url
 https://webappurl?id=120cs22203andin=true
```
